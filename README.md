## 🚨 Exploring the Risks of Extensive Virtual Reality Use! 🕶️

In this project, we analyzed the **Jigsaw** ransomware to understand its behavior and the techniques hackers use to attack systems.

---

## 🔍 What did we do?

- **Static Analysis:** Examined the malware without executing it to uncover its functions and hidden behaviors.  
- **Reverse Engineering:** Decoded the obfuscated code to understand how it encrypts files.  
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Executed the malware in a controlled environment to observe its real behavior.  
- **Persistence & Privilege Escalation Techniques:** Studied how the malware hides and gains system control.  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** Mapped attack tactics using an internationally recognized framework.

---

## ⚠️ Why is this important?

The Jigsaw ransomware is a real and sophisticated threat — understanding it is the first step to defending effectively.

---

## 🎯 Final Goal

Provide valuable insights to develop better defense and prevention systems against ransomware attacks.
